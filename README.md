## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **For coin creation (optional):**
   ```bash
   # Create .env.local for all coin creation functionality:
   echo "VITE_ZORA_API_KEY=your_zora_api_key" > .env.local
   echo "VITE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_without_0x" >> .env.local
   echo "VITE_RPC_URL=https://base-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-key" >> .env.local
   echo "VITE_PAYOUT_RECIPIENT=0xYourEthereumAddress" >> .env.local
   
   # Copy to .env for backend scripts (they read the same variables):
   cp .env.local .env
   ```

## Coin Creation Scripts

### Create a Quiz Coin
```bash
pnpm create-coin
```

### Query User's Coin Balances
```bash
pnpm get-coins <wallet_address>
```

## Environment Variables

For coin creation functionality, you'll need these variables in both `.env.local` (frontend) and `.env` (scripts):

- `VITE_ZORA_API_KEY`: Get from [Zora](https://zora.co/)
- `VITE_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your wallet's private key (without 0x prefix)
- `VITE_RPC_URL`: Base network RPC endpoint
- `VITE_PAYOUT_RECIPIENT`: Address to receive creator fees

**Note**: Both frontend and backend scripts now use the same `VITE_` prefixed variables for consistency.

## Development vs Production

### Development Mode
- Quiz creation uses simulated transactions
- No real coins are created
- Perfect for testing the UI/UX

### Production Mode
- Real coin creation using Zora's protocol
- Actual blockchain transactions
- Requires valid environment variables and gas fees

To enable production mode, set up your `.env` file and replace the simulated coin creation in `src/App.tsx` with real API calls to your backend.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Preview production build
pnpm preview

# Run linter
pnpm lint
```

## `farcaster.json`

The `/.well-known/farcaster.json` is served from the [public
directory](https://vite.dev/guide/assets) and can be updated by editing
`./public/.well-known/farcaster.json`.

You can also use the `public` directory to serve a static image for `splashBackgroundImageUrl`.

## Frame Embed

Add a the `fc:frame` in `index.html` to make your root app URL sharable in feeds:

```html
  <head>
    <!--- other tags --->
    <meta name="fc:frame" content='{"version":"next","imageUrl":"https://placehold.co/900x600.png?text=Frame%20Image","button":{"title":"Open","action":{"type":"launch_frame","name":"App Name","url":"https://app.com"}}}' /> 
  </head>
```
